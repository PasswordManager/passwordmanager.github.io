{"name":"Passman","tagline":"A graphical password manager","body":"# passman\r\nPassman is a password manager written in Haskell. It generates passwords from a\r\nmaster password and a short string. These strings are to be kept in a text file\r\nwhich passman will load to generate passwords. The generated passwords will be\r\n128 characters by default but can be shortened if required.\r\n\r\n## usage\r\nOn first usage, passman will prompt for a master password. This master password\r\nmust be entered each time a password is generated. To change the master\r\npassword, delete ~/.passman-masterpasswd but note that generated passwords will\r\nnow be different.\r\n\r\nTo generate a password, passman will prompt for the master password\r\n\r\n![enter-password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mat8913/passman/storage/enter-password.png)\r\n\r\nThe generated password will then be stored in clipboard.

If the password needs to be shorter than 128\r\ncharacters, add the length to the end of the line separated by a tab.
